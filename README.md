# TensorFlow 2.0: Advanced Auto Encoders: Project 2: AutoEncoders Traffic Sign Compression

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

 - Auto encoders are a type of Artificial Neural Networks that are used to perform a task of data encoding (representation learning).
- Auto encoders use the same input data for the input and output, Sounds crazy right!?
- Auto encoders work by adding a bottleneck in the network.
- This bottleneck forces the network to create a compressed (encoded) version of the original input
- Auto encoders work well if correlations exists between input data (performs poorly if the all input data is independent)
